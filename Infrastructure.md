# Infrastructure for Zero Trust Security in Azure

## Objectives

1. Workloads are monitored and alerted to abnormal behavior.

2. Every workload is assigned an app identityâ€”and configured and deployed consistently.

3. Human access to resources requires Just-In-Time.

4. Unauthorized deployments are blocked, and alert is triggered.

5. Granular visibility and access control are available across workloads.

6. User and resource access segmented for each workload.
